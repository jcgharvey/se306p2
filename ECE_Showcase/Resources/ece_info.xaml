    <Paragraph>
        The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is committed to research and dedicated to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, innovation and knowledge.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering holds the underlying belief that the best teachers are those constantly breaking new ground, a view supported by The University of Auckland’s philosophy of research-informed teaching.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering drives industry partnerships that enable cutting edge learning. We build on our experience and the innovation of our researchers to provide the very best standards in research and learning.

    <Paragraph>
        Courses and programmes are designed to ensure that our students will be successful when they enter their chosen industries. The focus of teaching is on specific technologies at undergraduate level, shifting to a strong research focus at postgraduate level.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        The department’s academic researchers and PhD students have long been at the forefront of learning. In 2000 the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering formalised a link with the Computer Science Department, recognising the importance of software as an engineering discipline. In the future, we aim to extend our industrial liaison and multi-disciplinary research projects to include medicine and biology.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        Undergraduates benefit from exposure to projects similar to entry-level engineers in industry while many past students, in demand by industry recruiters, have found senior positions with New Zealand’s foremost companies.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Auckland will equip positive, proactive people with the skills they require to embark on successful professional careers. Researchers’ potential is enabled with the very best environment and opportunities, and for industry we continue to be a vehicle for robust and successful research.
