    <Paragraph>
        Can't find time to pay that credit card bill? Thanks to the work of software engineers who instruct computers to perform functions like online bill-paying, it doesn't matter where in the world you are, as long as you have access to the internet, paying those bills is now a breeze. Ever wondered how your mobile phone works; how text messages, photos and videos are sent between phones or how you can access your email using your mobile phone? Software engineers are the people who design and maintain the software behind this functionality, and guarantee that it works.

        Software engineers combine their expertise in computer science, engineering and maths to design, develop and test software for various uses. Our software engineering students learn a variety of programming languages and how to design, analyse and maintain high quality software, and how to communicate and work with others.
