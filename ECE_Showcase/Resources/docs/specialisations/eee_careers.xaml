    <Paragraph>
        Electrical and electronic engineering encompasses diverse fields providing a range of employment opportunities and a 
        worldwide shortage of engineers in this field means graduates are in high demand. Graduates are employed in roles 
        related to communications, wireless computing technologies, electronics, instrumentation, power electronics and motor-control. 
        Opportunities are also available in the processing industries such as timber, pulp and paper, steel, aluminium, meat and dairy.
