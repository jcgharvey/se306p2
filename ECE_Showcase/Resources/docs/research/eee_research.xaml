    <Paragraph>
        In the past decade, power levels for IPT have increased from a few watts to several hundred kW. Such progress is placing stress on the available components and complexity of the control strategies to maintain stability. The goal is to make the system cost competitive with conventional wired systems.

    <Paragraph>
        Power electronics research and magnetic modeling combine in the area of IPT to find means of improving the quality of supply while reducing costs. New areas of research at both PhD and masters level include improved low cost power supplies, high band width communications, self tuned high-power pick-up regulators, better magnetic structures and improved controllers.
