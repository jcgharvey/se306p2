        Systems and control
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        In this field of research we have developed close links with the School of Biological Sciences, School of Medicine as well as other universities and industries in New Zealand.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        We also has extensive international links with universities and companies in USA, UK, Germany, Australia, Japan, China, Singapore and Korea. The research achievements are reflected by a large amount of publications in prestigious journals, invited lectures in international conferences and other scholarship activities.

        Processes optimisation
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        The issue of sustainable development has recently drawn considerable attention worldwide, and has stimulated researchers and engineers to make greater effort to reduce the cost/benefit-ratio for development and manufacture of bio-industrial processes both economically and environmentally. We have developed an extended recurrent neural network model for a fed-batch fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The aim of building this neural network model is to maximise the quantity of biomass by optimising the feed rate profiles.

        Synthesis and analysis of hybrid systems
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        Hybrid systems typically consist of signals that take values from a continuous set, and also variables that take values from a discrete, typically finite set. Some signals could be time-driven while others could be event-drive in an asynchronous manner. The objective of this research is to conduct a general investigation on synthesis and analysis of hybrid systems using hybrid automata.

        Control design of nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple time scales
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        Dynamical systems with multiple time scales are also called singularly perturbed systems or slow-fast systems. The aim of this research is to conduct a general investigation on

        How to design a controller for a nonlinear dynamical system with multiple time scales.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
        This proposal is motivated by the need to have singular perturbation analysis tools for nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple time scales.
